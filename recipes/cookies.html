        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, the urge to have a freshly-baked cookie is too strong.
                And what kind of person would I be if I didn't have some frozen 
                cookie dough on hand to curve those cravings? Today, I'll be following
                Melissa Stadler's <a href="https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recipe</a>
                for Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookies. She's modeled her cookies after those 
                sold at the popular Levain Bakery in New York City.
